# Installation in Gooble Colab

If you want to use Google Colab to run your notebooks, Jovyan AI can be setup quickly using [this example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OFqkgxkwzDuzyVTkxWwDzrtT9POlHCVM?usp=sharing)

This setup will launch a JupyterLab instance __inside__ your Colab session. So you can still use JupyterLab and JovyanAI with compute ressources from Colab.
